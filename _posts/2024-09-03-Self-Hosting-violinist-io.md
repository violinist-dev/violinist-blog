<p name="130e" id="130e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">Welcome to a new era of enhanced control with <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a>. If you are not aware, <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a> is a reliable helper for keeping your PHP / Composer codebases up to date, helping you stay at the forefront of security patches and feature improvements. We’re excited to share with you a new feature that puts more control in your hands: Self hosted runners!</p><figure name="02d0" id="02d0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sEf03GsXMzEce1o4q2_3dw.jpeg" data-width="1024" data-height="1024" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sEf03GsXMzEce1o4q2_3dw.jpeg"></figure><h3 name="f720" id="f720" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Problem Statement</h3><p name="3621" id="3621" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">At <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a>, we have a diverse set of customers, from larger enterprises to mid-sized agencies, and even to solo hobbyist projects. And it’s exactly the diversity of our customers and the unique requirements they bring in that makes us proud that we are able to cater for all of these groups.</p><p name="35c9" id="35c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Yet, we humbly acknowledge that sometimes our services might not fit the requirements of every single member of our group. The hurdles can range from wrestling with VPN-secured repositories, navigating specific corporate policies around third-party vendors, or even dealing with tightly phrased data processing agreements that discourage transferring code to other infrastructures.</p><p name="ff84" id="ff84" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It is tempting to look at the situation with a critical eye towards bureaucracy or corporate infrastructural inertia. However, we view these not as stupid constraints, but as natural protective mechanisms. These potential blockers lead us to the question: how can we help these organizations automate dependency updates when using an external service seems so… hard?</p><p name="b1cd" id="b1cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This is where we cue in our exciting solution: Self hosted runners!</p><h3 name="5aa2" id="5aa2" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">The New Feature: Self-Hosting Update Runners</h3><p name="6109" id="6109" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">What if you could just start a Docker container and have it function just as if you added a project to <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a>? With our new self-hosted update runners, this ability is simple and approachable for everyone. Currently in private beta, this feature just requires you to start a Docker container packed with your project update information, triggering a stream of pull requests like those you’d get directly from Violinist.io.</p><p name="172c" id="172c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The twist, though, is this: you’re no longer locked in to a third-party service for storing repository tokens and cloning code bases. Instead, it will run on your own chosen infrastructure. This not only gives you more control, but also enhances security and privacy.</p><p name="a83e" id="a83e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What’s more, since these update runners come as Docker containers, you have the convenience of putting them to work on your favourite CI platforms, making the deployment process much smoother and easier to handle.</p><h3 name="b181" id="b181" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">Benefits</h3><ul class="postList"><li name="4e27" id="4e27" class="graf graf--li graf-after--h3">With our self-hosted update runners, your organization keep full control of the data. Maintain complete ownership of your repository tokens and code bases within your established infrastructure, fortifying both security and control.</li><li name="1fbd" id="1fbd" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">No messing with dependencies with our streamlined solution’s requirements — a mere Docker image. This approach embraces enterprise standards for application scalability and portability. It even comes with arm64 support!</li><li name="9965" id="9965" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Our update runners gives you the flexibility to dictate the timing and frequency of updates. Cater to your organizations unique scheduling requirements, from planned maintenance windows to urgent, one-off updates.</li><li name="d041" id="d041" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">The powerful features that have made Violinist.io a trusted partner aren’t lost in this new offering.
