<p name="d524" id="d524" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">PHP 8.1 was releasedÂ lastÂ week. ðŸ¥³ As a project built for and by PHP, this is something to celebrate for <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a>.</p><p name="05c9" id="05c9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A key feature of Violinist.io is to be able to run the updates of your projects in the same environment as you use on your live site. While there are several ways to trick composer to run on the wrong version, we have found that making sure that the version is actually correct makes for the by far best result. Which is why we are proud to announce that we already support running your updates on PHP 8.1 (and have done so for several weeks).</p><p name="ae26" id="ae26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Probably this feature will not be used by everyone right away. After all, not many update production PHP version so fast. But the main reason we are able to offer it so fast at all, is the Docker based environment that powers our update infrastructure. We rely on the amazing <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/php" data-href="https://github.com/docker-library/php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Docker php library.</a> So while we celebrate early adoption, we also thank these amazing open source projects that helps us make updates easier for ourselves and you.</p><p name="bdcc" id="bdcc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happy updating!</p><p name="38d2" id="38d2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a></p>
