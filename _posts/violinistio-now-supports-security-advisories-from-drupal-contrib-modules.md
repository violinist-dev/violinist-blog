<p name="cf1f" id="cf1f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">In PHP land there is one advisory database that rules them all. It is <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" data-href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories</a>. This database contains Security Advisories from all kinds of composer based projects, including Drupal, Symfony, Magento, Typo3 and many others.</p><p name="fc2f" id="fc2f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Wouldn’t it be nice if this database also contained all of <a href="https://www.drupal.org/security/contrib" data-href="https://www.drupal.org/security/contrib" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the security advisories that are being published about Drupal contrib modules</a>? We think so too! Which is why <a href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/pull/371" data-href="https://github.com/FriendsOfPHP/security-advisories/pull/371" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">we tried to add this to the advisory database</a> back in February. Unfortunately this had some unexpected consequences.</p><p name="ef72" id="ef72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Drupal modules in the composer world have a “fake” semantic versioning. So the package drupal/metatag:1.0.0 refers to the release 7.x-1.0 when you are using <a href="https://packages.drupal.org/7" data-href="https://packages.drupal.org/7" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">packages.drupal.org/7</a> as your composer repository. And it refers to 8.x-1.0 when you are using <a href="https://packages.drupal.org/8" data-href="https://packages.drupal.org/8" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">packages.drupal.org/8</a> as your composer repository. Which means that if you are running a Drupal 7 project, a version 1.0.0 might have security vulnerabilities for Drupal 8, and therefore provide a false warning for your Drupal 7 project.</p><p name="52b6" id="52b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Luckily Violinist.io updates can alter the environment they run in. Which means we can include Drupal 7 contrib security advisories when relevant, and Drupal 8 contrib security advisories when relevant.</p><figure name="aec5" id="aec5" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*mEXfg--0l-HwCBcj3kWraw.png" data-width="823" data-height="116" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*mEXfg--0l-HwCBcj3kWraw.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Contrib update with a security&nbsp;advisory</figcaption></figure><p name="d333" id="d333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">There are two lessons to take from this: It would be great to start to use “real” semantic versioning for drupal contrib! There are several issues about this, for example this one: <a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3009338" data-href="https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3009338" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/3009338</a></p><p name="5c4d" id="5c4d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">The other lesson is that using <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a> you can get the security related information in your pull requests. <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">How about signing up for a completely free account now?</a></p>
