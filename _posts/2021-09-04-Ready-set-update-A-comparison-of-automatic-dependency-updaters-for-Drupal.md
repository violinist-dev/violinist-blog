I decided that this would be the perfect opportunity to compare different services for updating Drupal automatically. So for this blog post we are going to have a race! There are three contestants in this exciting race: <a href="https://dependabot.com/" data-href="https://dependabot.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dependabot</a>, <a href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate/" data-href="https://www.whitesourcesoftware.com/free-developer-tools/renovate/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Renovate</a> and¬†<a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a>. The purpose is to compare different composer dependency managers, and hopefully conclude that Violinist.io is the best one. This is the Violinist blog, after all! ‚úåÔ∏èü§ñ</p><p name="e031" id="e031" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">What we are looking for in a good automated security update are two things: Speed and accuracy. That is, how fast did it update, and does the service indicate that the update is a security release?</p><p name="23b0" id="23b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">According to Packagist, <a href="https://packagist.org/packages/drupal/core#9.2.4" data-href="https://packagist.org/packages/drupal/core#9.2.4" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Drupal 9.2.4 was released at 2021-08-12 17:48 UTC.</a> For this test, I decided to create a repo containing the default setup with composer, <a href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/install-composer.html" data-href="https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/install-composer.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">as recommended by the drupal.org documentation.</a> The repository is public, <a href="https://github.com/eiriksm/test-core-update" data-href="https://github.com/eiriksm/test-core-update" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">and can be found here.</a></p><p name="bd4b" id="bd4b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2021-005" data-href="https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2021-005" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The advisory for this version</a> does not specifically state what time it was published, but using the <a href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/apis/rest-and-other-apis" data-href="https://www.drupal.org/drupalorg/docs/apis/rest-and-other-apis" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drupal.org API </a>I can see the advisory node has a field called ‚Äúfirst published‚Äù, set to 2021-08-12 18:40 UTC. So basically, the release seems to be published around 50 minutes before the advisory, which makes sense.</p><p name="298d" id="298d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now.

However, after the advisory had been published, the PR was updated with information on it being a security release.</p><pre name="e489" id="e489" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">From 1c91216898c9d0f2be019b55fdf2fbebc37dcd18 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001<br>From: Violinist bot &lt;violinist-bot@users.noreply.github.com&gt;<br>Date: Thu, 12 Aug 2021 19:04:04 +0000<br>Subject: [PATCH] Update drupal/core-composer-scaffold</pre><figure name="0d63" id="0d63" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--pre"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*z81XBzMjyH_T0ldgx1ooQA.png" data-width="868" data-height="79" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*z81XBzMjyH_T0ldgx1ooQA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Title updated accordingly, after the advisory was published</figcaption></figure><p name="c3fc" id="c3fc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">To my knowledge, this update happened less than 30 minutes after the advisory was published, and a couple of hours before Renovate created its first PR.</p><h4 name="c6da" id="c6da" class="graf graf--h4 graf-after--p">Analysis</h4><p name="1992" id="1992" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h4">There are several interesting aspects here. One is the speed factor, which is purely based on this one data point. Not really conclusive, and perhaps not the most important finding. More interesting is perhaps the accuracy in the pull requests created. Out of the three services, only Violinist.io accurately identified the update to be a security update. This is not really surprising, since most security analysis tools in the PHP world uses the PHP Security Advisories Database for this. The Drupal 9.2.4 advisory was not merged into that database until September 1st. Violinist uses the drupal.org API to identify releases as security releases, and thus has this information at hand in real-time. Interestingly, none of the other two services have yet identified that the release was a security release, even though there has been an additional core release since then. This means that even if a PR is opened in due time, identifying a security release is either lacking or not identified in time.</p><p name="059e" id="059e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since this race coincidentally concluded with pointing out that <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">violinist.io</a> seems like the best fit for automated dependency management for Drupal sites, let‚Äôs transition to a short promotional paragraph:</p><p name="16f2" id="16f2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Do you want to have more automation in your project, but also increase security? You should definitely try an update tool for keeping your projects updated! There are several options for doing so, but this blog rather subjectively recommends Violinist.io for the job.
