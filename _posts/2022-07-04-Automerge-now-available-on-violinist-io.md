<p name="9ad9" id="9ad9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">You know what is better than automating processes? Automating even more processes! ðŸ’ª That's why you can <a href="https://docs.violinist.io/#automerge" data-href="https://docs.violinist.io/#automerge" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now enable automerge</a> directly from your Violinist config, which will affect the merge requests created by violinist.</p><p name="d750" id="d750" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When Violinist started, back in 2017, there was no automerge button on GitHub. And it actually started as a GitHub specific service! Fast forward to 2022. Automerge, a feature that makes the merge request automatically merge after tests/checks pass, is in the standard feature set of both GitHub and Gitlab, which we both support.</p><p name="ceac" id="ceac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We also added a certain granularity to the option. Or rather, added another very related option: <a href="https://docs.violinist.io/#automerge_security" data-href="https://docs.violinist.io/#automerge_security" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">automerge_security</strong></a>. This can be used if you want to enable automerge, but only if the update in question is a security update.</p><p name="b54b" id="b54b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Earlier if you wanted to automerge violinist updates, you would have to maintain a separate CI job for this purpose. Violinist, the website, has used this for several years. But now we celebrate, as we delete the custom CI script, and instead just use the option automerge directly. We hope this helps someone else as well. And that they too will have something to celebrate! ðŸª…</p><p name="1328" id="1328" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happy updating!</p><p name="26e8" id="26e8" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Violinist.io</p>
