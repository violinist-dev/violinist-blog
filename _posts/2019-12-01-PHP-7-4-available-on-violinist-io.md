<p name="4974" id="4974" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">PHP 7.4 was released yesterday. ðŸ¥³ As a project built for and by PHP, this is something to celebrate for Violinist.io.</p><p name="82d7" id="82d7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">A key feature of <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a> is to be able to run the updates of your projects in the same environment as you use on your live site. While there are several ways to run trick composer to run on the wrong version, we have found that making sure that is the case makes for the by far best result. Which is why we are proud to announce that by today (only hours after the release of PHP 7.4) you can already run your updates with version 7.4 on <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">violinist.io</a></p><p name="d19b" id="d19b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">While we anticipate a non-instant period for adoption of this feature (after all, not many update production PHP version so fast), the main reason we are able to offer it at all, is the Docker based environment that powers our update infrastructure. We rely on the amazing projects <a href="https://github.com/drupaldocker" data-href="https://github.com/drupaldocker" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drupaldocker</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/docker-library/php" data-href="https://github.com/docker-library/php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Docker php library</a>. So while we celebrate early adoption, we also thank these amazing open source projects that helps us make updates easier for ourselves and you.</p><p name="d22b" id="d22b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Happy updating!</p><p name="4c26" id="4c26" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Violinist.io</a></p>
