<p name="f62f" id="f62f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--h3">If you have reviewed a couple of code changes (in a merge request / pull request) you know that changes to a file like composer.lock can be a bit of a hassle to review. It can be long, it can be hard to parse, and it can be hard to spot what packages are updated. For example, updating a dependency that depend on symfony components could end up updating a whole range of packages, even if you expect such a merge request to contain more or less just updating the main package.</p><p name="c860" id="c860" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For example, if you want to update the package drush/drush you might do something like this:</p><pre name="d9d8" id="d9d8" class="graf graf--pre graf-after--p">$ composer update drush/drush --with-dependencies                                                                     <br>Loading composer repositories with package information<br>Updating dependencies (including require-dev)<br>Package operations: 0 installs, 2 updates, 0 removals<br>  - Updating nikic/php-parser (v4.8.0 =&gt; v4.9.1): Downloading (100%)         <br>  - Updating drush/drush (10.3.2 =&gt; 10.3.4): Loading from cache</pre><p name="ab2c" id="ab2c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pre">As we see here, even if we ran the update command for <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">drush/drush</strong>, the package <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">nikic/php-parser</strong> was also updated. For me, this is a feature. We get compatible new versions of dependencies. But in the context of a merge request claiming to <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">“Update drush/drush to version 10.3.4”</em>, especially if this is created automatically with <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">violinist.io</a>, it is not immediately obvious, and you would have to read through the composer.lock diff to find out. Well guess what? With <a href="https://violinist.io/" data-href="https://violinist.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">violinist.io</a> you don’t have to do that anymore!</p><figure name="694a" id="694a" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*sKz-YzA5m9wDAKt02lwFjA.gif" data-width="950" data-height="276" data-is-featured="true" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*sKz-YzA5m9wDAKt02lwFjA.gif"><figcaption class="imageCaption">Example of a transparent update list</figcaption></figure><p name="8d2e" id="8d2e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">We hope this feature will help you update and maintain your website even more effectively.
